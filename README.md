# AB-testing-small-samples

This repository contains the code for the calculations and figures that are contained in my blog post on A/B testing with small samples. It also contains copies of the figures that are in the blog post. You can find that blog post here:

Note that if you use this code to repeat the calculations then your results may look slightly different from the figures in the blog post. This is due to the random aspects of the calculation (drawing random samples from the binomial distribution). However, the differences should be small due to the large sample sizes that I used (10000 for the type 1 error calculation and 1000 for the power calculations).
